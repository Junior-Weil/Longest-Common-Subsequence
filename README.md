## Introduction

Briefly introduce your project. What does it do? What problem does it solve? Why is it useful?

This program efficiently finds the longest common subsequence of characters within two different arbitrarily large strings.
These algorithms are implemented based off of the Needleman Wunsch global sequence alignment and the Smith Waterman local
sequence alignment.

## Features

The algorithms both use dynamic programming to significantly decrease the run time. To brute force this alforithm the runtime would be O(2^m * n) assuming m <= n.
